# 🎓 AI/ML Student Portfolio (PWA-Enabled)

Hi, I’m **Siddhika Shukla**, an AI & Machine Learning student passionate about building intelligent systems and web-based applications.

This is my **personal portfolio website**, built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and fully converted into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. It works offline, can be installed as an app, and demonstrates my understanding of full-stack fundamentals and modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- 💡 Clean and minimal design
- 💻 Fully responsive (works on mobile and desktop)
- 🌐 Works offline using **Service Workers**
- 📱 Installable on mobile as a native-like app (PWA)
- 🔔 Ready for push notifications (optional)
- 🧠 Built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, JS
